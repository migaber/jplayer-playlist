# jplayer-playlist

A simple page using jPlayer, AngularJS and Bootstrap to compose a playlist.

## Background and Motivation
I often come across links to mp3s from podcasts, or recommended by friends. It would be much more convenient to organize the links into a playlist so that I could listen to the mp3s using a browser.

## How to use
1. Open 'index.html' in a browser.
2. Key in or drag URL links to mp3s into the box labeled 'Enter MP3'.
3. Click the button labeled 'Add MP3'.
4. Click the 'Play' button.
